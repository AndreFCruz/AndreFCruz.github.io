Hi!

I'm a PhD student at the MPI for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS), in Germany.
I'm part of the Social Foundations of Computation Department, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/).

My current research focus is on the fair and responsible use of Machine Learning, and the feedback loops between deployed ML systems and society at large.

Before joining MPI-IS, I was a Research Scientist on the Responsible AI group
at [Feedzai](https://research.feedzai.com/), a fintech startup :unicorn: where I researched and productized fair ML in real-world settings.
